# TextureBombing

A project I made for my Computer Graphics course in Keimyung University. The goal of this project was to write an OpenGL shader (GLSL) of our choice and display it in a simple window using C++ and FLTK for the GUI/Window manager.
I found the project to easy, so I made some kind of an editor where you can create simple 3D objects or load 3D models, move, scale or rotate them in the scene.
The created objects can load different shaders, so you can have a cell shaded torus, a checkboard cube, and so on. I learned a lot on Graphical Programming by doing this project.

## Requirements

- Visual Studio 2015
